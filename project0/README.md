ENGO 551 - Adv. Topics on Geospatial Technologies

A personal webpage about myself was created for this project. 

Four different webpage files are included index, about, contact, portfolio.

Index file contains website background and description information 
About file contains some things about me
Contact file contains contact information
Portfolio file contains information about my interests 

Due to issues initially getting webpages to display properly, separate html display files have been created with utf-8 encoding and are used for viewing the webpage. 
 
View the webpage by opening the html webpage display files.
